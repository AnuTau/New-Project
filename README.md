# Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In this document/project we will be discussing how to Build AI, AI compirses of multiple headings and topics that come together to create AI. "Dealing with Uncertainity is
one of the headings that is covered and deals with probability fundamentals and the Naive Beyes classifer. It is then followed by "Machine Learning" which focuses on multiple
tasks such as "Linear Regression", "The nearest neighbour method" as well as dealing with text and overfitting. Neural Networks is the final section of Building AI & its
focus is on Inputs , Hidden items & an Ouput


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* Problem 1 - It deals with automated drone servuilance. Allowing for more accurate overview and operations
* Problem 2 - Provides a delivery system that does the job in half the time.
* etc.


## How is it used?


Within the enviromental sector it will help with iradicating illegal hunters and poachers. This will be used to assist game rangers capture poachers and illegal hunters.

def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
The potential this project could bring and will bring is beyond description, it will create work, employ many and change the way people live.
